 # Welcome to **Pathfinding Visualizer** for **Mars Rover**.
 I hope that you will enjoy playing around with this tool. You can access it here: https://sathvikabm.github.io/MARS-Rover/

This application supports the following algorithms:

- Dijkstra's Algorithm (weighted)

-  A Search* (weighted)

- Greedy Best-first Search (weighted)

- Swarm Algorithm (weighted)

- Convergent Swarm Algorithm (weighted)

- Bidirectional Swarm Algorithm (weighted)

- Breath-first Search (unweighted)

- Depth-first Search (unweighted)

On top of the pathfinding algorithms listed above, We implemented a Recursive Division Maze Generation algorithm. Which has an option of both vertical and horizontal skew. You can generate Random Maze, Weight Maze, Stair Pattern as well.
