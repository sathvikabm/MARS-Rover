# Pathfinding Visualizer

Welcome to Mars Rover. I hope that you enjoy playing around with this tool. You can access it here (use Google Chrome!): https://sathvikabm.github.io/MARS-Rover/

## Meet the Algorithms

This application supports the following algorithms: 

**Dijkstra's Algorithm** (weighted)

**A* Search** (weighted)

**Greedy Best-first Search** (weighted)

**Swarm Algorithm** (weighted)

**Convergent Swarm Algorithm** (weighted)

**Bidirectional Swarm Algorithm** (weighted)

**Breath-first Search** (unweighted)

**Depth-first Search** (unweighted)

On top of the pathfinding algorithms listed above, We implemented a **Recursive Division** Maze Generation algorithm. Which has an option of both vertical and horizontal skew. You can generate Random Maze, Weight Maze, Stair Pattern as well.
